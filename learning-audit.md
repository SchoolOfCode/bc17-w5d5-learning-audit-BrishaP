Database


Learning Plan and Priorities:
1)I need to try PUT, DELETE and PATCH requests, I never got around to doing these.
-I will try to complete these tasks from the hackathon and ask others who got around to doing these tasks how they did it/ ask chatGPT to check my understanding
2)Try to use UUID's and date stamps as I never got around to doing these
-Try to complete these sections from the hackathon
3)Working with files
-I never got around to this section when working with files, I need to go over these videos and then figure this out/ understand this
